# SalmonLadderiLQR
Underactuated Robotics Final Project (Spring 2023)

iLQR_climber.ipynb tries to implement the trajectory optimization using iLQR (doesn't work because of exploding contact forces)

hybrid_climber_dircol.ipynb tries to implement the trajectory optimization using Drake's HybridMultibodyCollocation solver instead.
