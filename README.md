# SalmonLadderiLQR
Underactuated Robotics Final Project

iLQR_climber.ipynb tries to implement the trajectory optimization using iLQR (doesn't work because of exploding contact forces)
hybrid_climber_dircol.ipynb tries to implement the trajectory optimization using Drake's HybridMultibodyCollocation solver instead.
